# Commerce PartPay

[Commerce PartPay](http://drupal.org/project/commerce_partpay) integrates PartPay with Drupal Commerce payment and checkout system.

## Features

Commerce PartPay supports gateway hosted billing methods.

## Available Payment Methods

### PartPay

[PartPay](https://partpay.co.nz) is a 
payment solution hosted by PartPay; your site won't see credit card details so
you have fewer requirements for compliance. It's safer and simpler to implement.


## Installation & Configuration

1. Download from [Commerce PartPay project page](http://drupal.org/project/commerce_partpay)
2. Enable the payment module.
3. Visit the Commerce Payment Methods page at admin/commerce/config/payment-methods
4. Enable and edit the payment methods you require.

## Troubleshooting

For any questions, the first point of reference should be the issue queue on Drupal.org. 
Please use the search interface provided to see if your problem has been fixed or is 
currently being worked on, and if not create a new issue to discuss it.

Always check your site error logs (both webserver and Drupal logs) and give detail when
making a report.

Documentation fixes are welcome!

## Contributing

We prefer that you use the Drupal.org issue queue, but contributions are welcome via
Github also.
